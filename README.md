# ðŸ¦  Malware Simulation + Removal (EICAR Test)

### ðŸŽ¯ Description  
This project simulates a malware detection scenario using the industry-standard EICAR test file in a Windows 10 virtual machine. It demonstrates how antivirus tools like Windows Defender and Malwarebytes detect, quarantine, and report threats. The goal is to practice basic endpoint protection, scanning, and incident loggingâ€”skills used in both help desk and SOC environments.

### ðŸ›  Tools Used  
- VirtualBox (Windows 10 VM)  
- Notepad  
- Windows Security (Defender)  
- Malwarebytes Free

---

### ðŸ§ª What I Did  

- âœ… Created a fake malware file using the official EICAR test string  
- âœ… Saved it in the VM and triggered Windows Defender  
- âœ… Verified Defenderâ€™s detection and automatic quarantine  
- âœ… Viewed event in **Protection History**  
- âœ… (Optional) Installed and ran Malwarebytes Free to cross-check scan results

---

### ðŸ§  Key Learnings  

- How antivirus software detects and handles known malware  
- Where to find **quarantine logs** and protection history in Windows  
- How to test AV response without real threat exposure  
- The difference between **real-time protection** vs **manual scanning**  
- Tools used by Tier 1 support, SOC analysts, and IT compliance teams

---

### ðŸ’¼ Real-World Use Case  

- **Help Desk**: Assisting users who click on suspicious links or download infected files  
- **SOC Support**: Monitoring endpoint threat logs and verifying antivirus actions  
- **Compliance/Audit**: Demonstrating antivirus response and log retention during internal or external reviews

---

### âœ… Outcome  
Successfully simulated a malware incident using the EICAR file. Observed system response, confirmed log generation, and reinforced understanding of endpoint protection behavior in Windows environments.
